              <p>A woman's beauty is from head to toe, and many women will not let go of the beauty of any detail of their bodies. The hands are the most frequently used limbs in our daily life, and they are also one of the parts that women pay the most attention to. The prevalence of nail art has brought a new pursuit of beauty to every woman, that is, the fingers can be beautiful, which has become the symbol of the new era of women.<br>
What is the necessary nail art for this fall and winter? All of these nail art represents the popular fashion for the fall/winter season of 2021, so it is worth to talk or discuss about it specially. What kind of effect can these nail art give us, is it whitening or temperament? Whether it is the former or the latter, they are what women are constantly seeking. If you're interested, let's explore the trends for the fall and winter seasons!<br>

<h2 id="1persimmon-nail-art">1.Persimmon nail art</h2>
<p>As the name implies, it is a persimmon nail art, which uses persimmon as the base color for the nail art, and then uses other colors as secondary shades. The purpose of this color scheme is that persimmon is a very white base color that will make your fingers look white. This is a great way to make your hands look white and not monotonous, so it's a good idea for girls who are still in school or young to try it out.<br>
The subtlety of this nail art lies in the fact that if it had persimmon color as the main color for a large area, then this nail art would have become plain and boring. Instead, it goes the other way and chooses other light colors as secondary colors, and the whole temperament is different. The nail becomes clear and lively at the same time, which is the fashion trend for this fall and winter season.<br>

<h2 id="2-crystal-jelly-nail-art">2. Crystal jelly nail art</h2>
<p>The nail art is very easy to understand, it is the nail art that is shaped by the nail polish with various colors. This one is mainly in peach color with blue edge of the nail head to achieve a girly look for the fall and winter season. The blue border is lively and gentle, and the simple style is not monotonous and boring. It is suitable for girls who like simple style, but also for girls who want to take a temperament style.<br>
The clear crystal jelly also meets the temperament of the autumn and winter season, and the gentle temperament of a young girl comes through between the clear nail. The border carries a slight French temperament that is heartwarming and satisfies the basic requirement of showing white as a nail art.<br>

<h2 id="3-french-nail-art">3.  French nail art</h2>
<p>This black and green French nail art is slightly different from the normal French nail art, it has a cool style with a black and green tone. Many people think that French and cool are two styles, but they don't think that they can be combined. Black is the main color that gives the nail a white base, while fluorescent green brings a cool tech feel through fluorescence.<br>
This manicure is perfect for girls who go for a cool style, because the border also completes the basic French pattern. This manicure is also considered a French gentle rebellion. It completes an innovative nail art style with a cool vibe fused with French nail art!<br>

<p>The nail art above is actually white in tone, so the nail art style itself is very intentional. With white as the base tone, then the other auxiliary colors can play a wonderful effect, which makes them the trend of this year. In short, the blogger was moved, I wonder if we should also try it?</p>
