<p>Leopard nail art can also be made in many different effects, depending on the color combination of the leopard nail art. For example, a leopard print manicure created by combining red and black on a white nail surface looks very fresh and sexy at the same time, presenting a diverse charm that is perfect for girls with different personalities.<br>

<p>The frosted texture of leopard print nail art is also a style that many fashionistas like. The matte nail surface can better restore the fur texture of the leopard print, making the leopard print look more realistic, while also increasing the fashionable temperament of the nail, low-key and very gorgeous, fashionable and not flashy, very unique!<br>

<p>Leopard print nails have a small texture and look relatively dense, so they are not suitable for a single style. If you do leopard nail art on all ten fingers, it will look fancy and have a dazzling feeling, so usually we choose a simple solid color nail with leopard nail art, which can neutralize the fancy feeling of leopard print and make the fingertips look more atmospheric.<br>
