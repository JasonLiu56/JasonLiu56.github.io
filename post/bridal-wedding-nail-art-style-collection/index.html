<h2 id="1how-to-choose-a-wedding-nail-art-style-that-suits-you">1.How to choose a wedding nail art style that suits you</h2>
<p>Let's first consider the base length and shape of the nail art. If some brides have slightly short fingers and nails, then we can leave the nails long in advance, around 2-4mm. Then let the nail art staff help you to trim tiny squares or oval shape, which can slightly elongate the sense of the line of the hand. However, if you have slightly thicker fingers, it is not recommended to leave your nails long, as it will look a bit chunky. Oval nails will look longer because they are more slender and can generally achieve the elongated effect that girls want. But nails should never be left too long because they will look too sharp. In addition to the inconvenience of movement, it is also visually sharper. And the design of the square and round shape can also add a certain amount of femininity.</p>
