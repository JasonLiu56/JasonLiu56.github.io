              <p>What kind of nail art do you girls like to do in winter? The blogger, who is self-absorbed and beautiful, just did a nail for herself today and couldn't resist sharing with you some types of nail art that are suitable for winter and look good. The winter weather is dry, and hands are especially prone to roughness and cracking, so you can't be lazy and not give your hands the care they need. Remember to apply hand cream to your hands every day to protect your hands, and you girls and best friends can do beautiful nails together!<br>

<h2 id="1-leopard-print-elements-nail-art">1. Leopard print elements nail art</h2>
<p>The leopard print is a fashion element that never goes out of style and it can easily be matched with leopard print clothing, bags and nail art. A girl with leopard print will be very attractive and beautiful. The leopard print nail art became popular at the end of 2020.I have a lot of beautiful friends around me who have done leopard nails, I also want to try, but I always feel that I do not do well, so I control the enthusiasm of my heart.<br>
<img src="https://www.fazhion.xyz/post-images/1636975508634.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This nail art uses reddish brown and pink as the base color, it will look overall white hands. You can also choose your favorite color, and for example, using black, earthy orange, pink outline different shapes of leopard print, and then with the sweater. It looks very style and temperament.<br>

<h2 id="2gradient-fresh-style-nail-art">2.Gradient fresh style nail art</h2>
<p>For girls who go sweet and fresh style need to pay attention, in winter nail art you must avoid candy colors and fluorescent colors and other colors, which will look rather abrupt. The gradient halo color like this is a good choice, not only will not look very abrupt in winter, but also very fresh and lovely. It is recommended to choose the brighter colors of burgundy and creamy pink. These two colors are easier to look your hands whiter, a more harmonious, natural, not a complex and messy feeling. Placing the gradient halo style of painting will look more fresh and stylish.<br>

<p>If you add some smile of fine glitter will be more colorful, and with red shiny nail polish to do gradient is also very good-looking!<br>

<h2 id="3-black-and-white-minimalist-style-nail-art">3. Black and white minimalist style nail art</h2>
<p>Black and white are extremely simple and classic styles, and these two colors will look very high class when used for nail art. However, it is not suitable for girls with slightly darker hands. This nail is pure black and white for the finger base, and then use the brush to paint some marble pattern to the nail. The overall look is relatively simple, and there is a sense of seniority, in which the marble pattern can greatly enhance the texture of the ground.<br>

<p>This style is more suitable whether in winter or summer, and that black and white used to do polka dot shape or draw lines is also very good!<br>

<h2 id="4aqua-with-diamond-style-nail-art">4.Aqua with diamond style nail art</h2>
<p>If you have long, thin nails, you'll look great with this type of manicure! This nail art does not stick the nail piece, but use light pink milk tea color and glitter silver as the overall tone, and then use the big rhinestone and a shell piece to make the shape. The whole finger is shining brightly. Especially in the light and sunlight, this nail art will really shine.<br>
<img src="https://www.fazhion.xyz/post-images/1636975815617.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The overall look of this type of nail will be more complex and advanced, and perfectly in line with the winter season, which is a heavy dressing. But for girls with fragile nails, it is not recommended to do this nail art directly to your own nails, because it is easy to hurt your nails and does not last a long time, nail chips are your best choice!<br>

<h2 id="5solid-wine-red-color-nail-art">5.Solid wine red color nail art</h2>
<p>Finally, attaching pictures are two nails art looks from the blogger, because this is a style that I am interested in doing, so it is not as delicate and accept your criticisms or suggestions. This nail is a darker wine red color and the same accessories. Only one nail is done with gradient halo and pure color bright flash, In the thumb, I stick a gold circle sticker, and the overall color and tone is still more suitable for winter. Surprisingly, it makes the hands very white, and under the light shine bloggers are in love with my hands!<br>

<p>Do you have the urge to do nail art when you see it here? The nail is not suitable to do often, but after doing it always feel like the most exquisite and elegant beauty.  Reminding everyone to never use their hands to pick off the nail, it is best to wait for it to fall off naturally or specifically to unload.</p>
