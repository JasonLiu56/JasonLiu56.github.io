What is the hottest?  Today,  I will bring you a detail introduction.</p>
<h2 id="1-shiny-gold-nail-art">1. Shiny Gold Nail Art</h2>
<p>​Although it has to be applied to real life,  these gorgeous and advanced nail styles are something that you can not help but try. Many peeps select elongated styles to bring out their high-end feel,  but for the convenience of life,  these shorts are also perfect. Use your favorite color as a base,  then apply shiny gold on top,  these somewhat monotonous appearance,  become instantly luxurious.

<h2 id="2-white-small-flower-nail-art">2. White Small Flower Nail Art</h2>
<p>​These solid color mirror nails are still loved by many young in real life. The so-called plain mirror color is a nail art that is chosen with a single color,   with no additional color added. Combined with the smooth appearance,  it looks shiny when exposed to light or sunlight.  Naturally there will be people who don't like this slightly monotonous nail art,  so adding a few small touches can be an effective solution to this problem.  This fishing manicure with the small white flower added on top is very soft and soft.<br>

<h2 id="3-white-edge-nail-art">3. White Edge Nail Art</h2>
<p>​If you don't want to add small white flowers,  you think the accents are a bit brusque. There are many other options at this point, after all, nail art can be whatever you want it to be,  and if you are handy enough,  you can totally design it for yourself.  The nail is painted with a colour and a white border is added at the top.  This style of nail art is quite popular amongst girls nowadays.  Not only does it add a vivid colour,  but it also looks very neat.<br>

<p>​The nail art above,  in its entirety,  is pink and then a white border is painted on top. The combination of soft pink and vivid white,  is unique and distinctive. This one has a blue border,  which is as pink overall,  but the color is lighter than the one above.  This nail art looks very cool and enjoyable after adding a blue border.  This way,  you can see that the colour of the ridge can be chosen at will.<br>

<h2 id="4-color-blocking-nail-art">4. Color Blocking Nail Art</h2>
<p>​Like the side nail art,  which is also made up of two colors,  the color blocking nail art is worth a try.  This nail art,  composed of blue and white,  is perfect for light autumn days and brings a touch of pleasure to the heart. This nail art is slightly different,  since it is only on the ring finger.  If you think it's a bit monotonous,  you can freely choose the color that you want to put together,  and it's not limited to one color.  In addition,  you can choose a color combination on each nail,  but this will look a bit tedious.<br>

<h2 id="5-color-jumping-nail-art">5. Color Jumping Nail Art</h2>
<p>​Last but not least,  I would like to share with you a color jumping manicure.  As the name suggests,  color jumping means that the nails are one color apart but different. The one I'm introducing is made up of green and white,  with white on the thumb,  middle finger and little finger,  and green on the index finger and ring finger.  The two colors set off each other and look very original and unique.<br>
